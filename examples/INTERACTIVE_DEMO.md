## 📋 Requirements

### API Keys (Required)
You'll need API keys for the AI models you want to use:

**Minimum:** At least 2 of the following:
- 🔑 **OpenAI API Key** (for GPT)
  - Get it: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

- 🔑 **Anthropic API Key** (for Claude)
  - Get it: https://console.anthropic.com/

- 🔑 **XAI API Key** (for Grok)
  - Get it: https://console.x.ai/

### Budget
- **Estimated cost per tournament:** $0.50 - $2.00
- **Runtime:** 5-10 minutes
- **Tip:** Start with 2-3 cheaper models (Gemini + GPT-4) to minimize cost

---

## 🎯 What You'll Experience

### Real Tournament Execution
1. **Phase 1: Initial Responses**
   - Each AI model independently analyzes your question
   - Real API calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.

2. **Phase 2: Improvement**
   - Models see each other's responses
   - Generate improved versions based on peer feedback

3. **Phase 3: Evaluation & Elimination**
   - Cross-evaluation scores all responses
   - Weakest model eliminated
   - **Knowledge Bank** preserves its best insights

4. **Repeat**
   - Process continues until one champion remains
   - Champion incorporates insights from all eliminated models

### Real Metrics
- 💰 **Exact cost tracking** (down to $0.0001)
- ⏱️ **Real-time execution monitoring**
- 📊 **Per-model cost breakdown**
- 📁 **Downloadable tournament reports**

## 📖 Demo Walkthrough

### Step 1: Install Framework
```python
# Try PyPI first (once published)
import micropip
await micropip.install('arbitrium')

# Or from GitHub:
# !pip install git+https://github.com/arbitrium-framework/arbitrium.git
```

### Step 2: Configure API Keys
Interactive prompt to securely enter your API keys:
```python
import getpass
openai_key = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key: ")
```

**Security:** Keys stay in your browser session only!

### Step 3: Initialize Tournament
```python
from arbitrium import Arbitrium

arbitrium = await Arbitrium.from_settings(config)
# Health checks all models
```

### Step 4: Define Your Question
```python
question = """
Should our startup focus on PLG or SLG?
Context: B2B SaaS, $500k funding...
"""
```

### Step 5: Run Tournament!
```python
result, metrics = await arbitrium.run_tournament(question)

print(f"Champion: {metrics['champion_model']}")
print(f"Cost: ${metrics['total_cost']:.4f}")
print(result)
```

### Step 6: Analyze Results
- View champion solution
- Download detailed reports
- Compare with single-model baseline

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Choose Good Questions
✅ **Good:**
- Strategic business decisions
- Technical architecture choices
- Complex trade-off analysis
- Multi-stakeholder synthesis

❌ **Poor:**
- Simple factual queries
- Time-sensitive decisions
- Questions with objective answers

### Optimize Costs
1. Start with 2-3 models (not 4+)
2. Use cheaper models for testing:
   - Gemini 1.5 Flash (~$0.10)
   - GPT-4 Turbo Mini (~$0.15)
3. Test with shorter questions first
4. Monitor costs in real-time

### Maximize Value
- Use for decisions worth $5,000+
- Questions where diverse perspectives help
- When you need audit trails
- For compliance-sensitive decisions

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Your API Keys
- ✅ Entered via secure `getpass` prompt
- ✅ Stored only in session memory
- ✅ Never sent to any server (except AI providers)
- ✅ Cleared when notebook closes

### Your Data
- ✅ Questions sent only to AI providers you choose
- ✅ Results stay in your browser
- ✅ No analytics or tracking
- ✅ Open source - verify yourself!

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'arbitrium'"
**Solution:** Run the installation cell:
```python
import micropip
await micropip.install('arbitrium')
```

### "Need at least 2 healthy models"
**Solution:**
- Check API keys are correct
- Ensure you have sufficient API quota
- Try different model providers

### "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution:**
- Wait a few minutes
- Use different API key
- Reduce number of concurrent models

### High costs
**Solution:**
- Start with 2 models instead of 4
- Use cheaper models (Gemini Flash)
- Test with shorter questions

## 📚 Example Questions to Try

### Business Strategy
```
Should we pivot from B2B to B2C, given our current runway
and market feedback?
```

### Technical Architecture
```
What is the best data pipeline architecture for processing
1TB/day of event data with <1 hour latency?
```

### Product Roadmap
```
Which 3 features should we prioritize for Q2 to maximize
user retention and revenue?
```

### Market Analysis
```
Should we enter the European market now or wait 12 months
to build more features?
```
